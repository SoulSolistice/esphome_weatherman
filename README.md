# esphome_weatherman

Native [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) firmware for the [stall.biz WEATHERMAN 2.1](https://www.stall.biz/project/der-weatherman-2-1-die-ideale-wetterstation-fuer-die-hausautomation/)
weather station, replacing the closed-source `wm21_xx.bin` firmware with a fully
open, Home Assistant-native node.

Includes a custom ESPHome component (`tfa_tx141w`) that decodes the wired
data tap from the TFA Dostmann 30.3222.02 wind head — which is a re-branded
LaCrosse TX141W — by timing the baseband OOK pulses on a GPIO and validating
the rtl_433 protocol in software. No SDR, no RF receiver, no calls home.

## Features

- Full feature parity with the original firmware's `wm_*` variables
  (see [parity table](#wm_-variable-parity) below).
- All measurements published via the native ESPHome / Home Assistant API and
  optionally MQTT (for existing subscribers to the `wm/*` topic tree).
- **Built-in web UI** on port 80 for standalone access without
  Home Assistant. Useful for tuning thresholds, viewing live values,
  and as an OTA fallback.
- Rain heater control: manual 0–100 % slider, or automatic mode combining
  anti-dew (dewpoint margin), frost protection, and post-rain drying (heats
  while rain is detected to dry the comb and restore responsiveness sooner).
- Pulse-width histogram and per-stage failure counters in the decoder logs,
  so the TFA decoder can be tuned without a scope.

## Runtime configuration

The following calibration parameters are exposed as runtime `number:` entities
and can be tuned without re-flashing via Home Assistant, the on-device web UI,
or MQTT:

| Number entity                       | Original firmware param | Default |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Altitude                            | `altitude` (param 20)   | 513 m   |
| Rain bucket calibration             | `regen_koeff` (param 11)| 0.485 mm/tick |
| Sun lux threshold                   | `sonne_lux_schwelle` (param 10) | 8000 lx |
| Rain detector threshold             | `regenschwelle` (param 6) | 16 %  |
| Heater dewpoint margin              | `tau_schaltschwelle` (param 27) | 2.0 °C |
| Heater frost-protect temperature    | (new in v0.3)           | 2.0 °C |
| Heater frost-protect band           | (new) ramp width above frost temp | 2.0 °C |
| Rain comb dry baseline              | (new) per-unit comb cal | 6 µs   |
| Rain comb wet saturation            | (new) per-unit comb cal | 67 µs  |
| Rain heating duty                   | (new) heater % while rain detected | 100 % |

The two rain-comb calibration values are per-unit: the comb's active-sense
discharge time depends on C1 tolerance and the input threshold, so they're
calibrated in the field rather than baked into the firmware. See
[hardware-rain-sensor.md](docs/hardware-rain-sensor.md) for the procedure.

Each value restores across reboots. Flash wear is negligible because
user-initiated config changes happen only a handful of times in a
device's lifetime.

Other parameters (TFA decoder timings, network identity, MQTT broker
address) remain as YAML substitutions because they're set at flash time
and changing them implies a re-flash anyway.

## Scope and non-goals

- **CCU interface is not implemented.** The original firmware optionally
  pushes values to a Homematic CCU. This project explicitly drops that
  path; everything goes through ESPHome's HA-native API and/or MQTT.
- **Sun position (elevation, azimuth, minutes-to-sunrise) is not
  computed on-device.** Delegate to Home Assistant's
  [`sun`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sun/) integration.
- **Rainfall accumulation periods** (`heute`, `gestern`, `letzte Stunde`)
  are not computed on-device. Use HA's `utility_meter` helper; the ESP
  publishes the lifetime total only.

## Quick start

### 1. Get the config

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoulSolistice/esphome_weatherman.git
cd esphome_weatherman/example
cp secrets.yaml.example secrets.yaml
# edit secrets.yaml with WiFi credentials
# edit weatherman.yaml: MQTT broker, altitude, static IP, etc. as desired
```

### 2. First flash

The WeMos D1 mini is sealed inside the polycarbonate box, and the original
proprietary firmware doesn't expose an ESPHome-compatible OTA partition,
so **the first flash must be done over USB**. Three options:

**Option A: ESPHome CLI (developer-friendly)**
```bash
esphome run weatherman.yaml --device /dev/ttyUSB0
```
If `/dev/ttyUSB0` doesn't appear, install the CH340 driver from
[wch.cn](https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH340.html) or your distro's
package repository.

**Option B: ESPHome Web Tools (no install required)**

Compile a binary first (locally, in Home Assistant's ESPHome add-on, or
via the [ESPHome Builder](https://web.esphome.io/) web tool itself):
```bash
esphome compile weatherman.yaml
# binary appears at .esphome/build/weatherman/.pioenvs/weatherman/firmware.bin
```

Then visit [web.esphome.io](https://web.esphome.io/) in a Chromium-based
browser (Chrome / Edge / Brave), click **Connect**, select your serial
port from the prompt, and upload the firmware.bin. Requires Web Serial
API support, which Firefox and Safari don't have.

**Option C: Home Assistant Add-on**

If you run Home Assistant OS / Supervised, install the ESPHome add-on
from the add-on store. It provides a web UI for compiling and a USB
passthrough for first flash. After the initial flash, the device appears
in the add-on dashboard and all subsequent updates are OTA.

Once the first flash is successful and the device joins your WiFi,
**reseal the box** — all future updates and parameter tuning happen
over the air.

### 3. Tune the TFA decoder if needed

Watch the logs: `esphome logs weatherman.yaml`. You should see a
pulse-width histogram every 30 s; once `packets_valid` starts climbing,
the decoder is locked in. If not, follow the
[trial-and-error guide](docs/tuning.md).

### 4. Lock down

Once everything's stable:

- In `weatherman.yaml`: set `tfa_tx141w.debug: false` and
  `logger.level: INFO`.
- Apply via OTA: `esphome run weatherman.yaml`.

## Consuming this repo as an external component

Other ESPHome configurations can pull just the `tfa_tx141w` component:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/SoulSolistice/esphome_weatherman
      ref: main
    components: [ tfa_tx141w ]
```

Components live at the conventional `components/` path, so no `path:` is
needed. For local development against your own checkout:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: local
      path: ../components       # relative to the YAML location
    components: [ tfa_tx141w ]
```

The component supports multiple instances; useful if
you ever want to read two TFA heads from different GPIOs on the same
board.

## Firmware source pinning

The example configuration defaults to tracking `main`, which follows the
latest repository state. If you want reproducible builds, set
`weatherman_ref` to a specific released tag instead of `main`.

## Hardware (WEATHERMAN 2.1)

The original Bauanleitung is on
[stall.biz](https://www.stall.biz/project/der-weatherman-2-1-die-ideale-wetterstation-fuer-die-hausautomation/).
GPIO assignments for this firmware, verified against page 25 of
Bauanleitung ver. 10:

| Component                      | Interface          | GPIO        |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| TFA Dostmann 30.3222.02        | open-collector (T2 BC547C in head) + R1 4k7 pullup | GPIO12 (D6) |
| BMP280 (P/T)                   | I²C @ 0x76         | GPIO5 / 4   |
| BH1750 (illuminance)           | I²C @ 0x23         | GPIO5 / 4   |
| WH-SP-RG rain bucket (reed)    | digital pulse      | GPIO14 (D5) |
| Rain comb (active RC-discharge sense) | timed charge/discharge on D7; R6 100k bridges to D8's 12k pulldown as bias reference (see [hardware-rain-sensor.md](docs/hardware-rain-sensor.md)) | GPIO13 (D7) / GPIO15 (D8 bias only) |
| Rain comb heater               | PWM (low-side BJT) | GPIO0  (D3) |
| DS18B20 optional shaded probe  | 1-wire             | GPIO2  (D4) |

### Boot-pin notes

- **GPIO0 (heater)**: must be HIGH at boot. WeMos internal pullup handles
  this. Heater may pulse briefly during boot.
- **GPIO2 (DS18B20)**: must be HIGH at boot. The 4.7 kΩ pullup in the
  DS18B20 circuit handles this.
- **GPIO15 (rain comb bias)**: must be LOW at boot. The WeMos D1 mini's
  on-board 12 kΩ pulldown (R11) handles this, which is why the main board's
  own `R10`/`R11` footprints are left unpopulated. That same 12 kΩ does
  double duty: through R6 (100 kΩ) it gives the comb sense node a fixed weak
  bleed to GND, in parallel with the comb itself. Leave GPIO15 undeclared in
  the YAML — it is neither driven nor read.
- **GPIO13 (rain comb sense)**: no boot-strap constraint. The rain-sense
  lambda flips it between OUTPUT and INPUT itself, so it must not be claimed
  by any other component. See
  [docs/hardware-rain-sensor.md](docs/hardware-rain-sensor.md) for the
  active-sense method and why the comb is read here rather than on D8.

## wm_* variable parity

The original firmware exposed values both as MQTT topics and as CCU
system variables. The CCU path is out of scope here; the table below
maps each `wm_*` variable to its ESPHome implementation.

| Original `wm_*` variable      | Type     | Unit  | Implementation                                     |
|-------------------------------|----------|-------|---------------------------------------------------|

| `wm_wind_dir`                 | number   | °     | TFA decoder → `Wind direction` (only with vane)   |
| `wm_windrichtung`             | string   | —     | template text → `Wind direction (cardinal)`      |
| `wm_lux`                      | number   | lux   | BH1750 → `Illuminance`                            |
| `wm_uv_index`                 | number   | —     | **not implemented** (no UV sensor on this hardware) |

| `wm_regenstaerke`             | number   | mm/h  | pulse_counter → `Rain rate`. Quantitative intensity (the comb is presence-only). |
| `wm_regen_letzte_h`           | number   | mm    | delegate to HA `utility_meter`                    |
| `wm_regen_mm_heute`           | number   | mm    | delegate to HA `utility_meter`                    |

## Home Assistant helpers

### Rainfall periods

```yaml
utility_meter:
  rain_today:
    source: sensor.weatherman_rain_total
    cycle: daily
  rain_last_hour:
    source: sensor.weatherman_rain_total
    cycle: hourly
```

For "rain yesterday" the cleanest approach is a `statistics` sensor
combined with HA's long-term statistics retention, or read the
previous day's value from `utility_meter.rain_today` history.

### Daily sun/rain hours

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: history_stats
    name: "Sun hours today"
    entity_id: binary_sensor.weatherman_sun_is_shining
    state: "on"
    type: time
    start: "{{ today_at('00:00') }}"
    end: "{{ now() }}"
  - platform: history_stats
    name: "Rain hours today"
    entity_id: binary_sensor.weatherman_rain_detector
    state: "on"
    type: time
    start: "{{ today_at('00:00') }}"
    end: "{{ now() }}"
```

### Barometric trend

The on-device `Barometric trend` classifies the 3-hour pressure change into
seven categories using NOAA-style thresholds:

| Threshold (Δp hPa/3h) | Rising label     | Falling label   |
| --------------------- | :---------------- | :--------------- |
| < 0.1                 | stabil           | stabil          |
| 0.1 – 1.35            | langsam steigend | langsam fallend |
| 1.35 – 6.0            | steigend         | fallend         |
| > 6.0                 | schnell steigend | schnell fallend |

The companion `Pressure change (3h)` numeric sensor publishes the raw Δp
value (hPa) and is useful for charting. If you want a continuous rate in
hPa/h for automations, HA's `derivative` integration can derive it:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: derivative
    source: sensor.weatherman_barometric_pressure_sea_level
    name: "Pressure trend (hPa/h)"
    round: 2
    unit_time: h
    time_window: "03:00:00"
```

### Sun position

Already provided by HA's built-in `sun` integration — no configuration needed.
Use `sensor.sun_next_dawn`, `sensor.sun_next_setting`, `sun.sun.attributes.elevation`, etc.

### Feels-like / UTCI

The ESPHome side already exposes `Wind chill` (NOAA) and `Apparent
temperature` (BoM/Steadman). For closer-to-UTCI accuracy you'd need
mean radiant temperature, which this hardware doesn't measure. See
[docs/feels-like.md](docs/feels-like.md) for the discussion.
